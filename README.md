# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this project is to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Results:
* we have used COUNT() function to create a table that has the number of retirement-age employees by most recent job title. It was found that Senior Engineers are the ones that are about to be retired followed by Senior Staff as shown in the figure below:

* A mentorship-eligibility table that holds the current employees who were born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965. There are about 1549 employees identified eligible for the mentorship program as shown in the fig below:

* for the immidiate future needs, I changed the query to see how many employees will be retirning in the next year by looking at e.birth_date between '1952-01-01' and '1952-12-31' and found out that 31,374 employees will be retiring in a year, which is better than looking at all the employees retirning in next three years to plan ahead.
